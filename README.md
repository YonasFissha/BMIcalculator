# BMI Calculator ðŸ’ª

## My Goal

The objective of this App is to show how I can customise Flutter Widgets to achieve a beautiful user interface designs. If you have a designer on board, no matter how unconventional their designs are, I can create them using Flutter.

## What you i create

I am going to make a Body Mass Index Calculator inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Ruben Vaalt](https://dribbble.com/shots/4585382-Simple-BMI-Calculator). It will be a multi screen app with simple functionality but full-on custom styling.

## What skills will this app show

- Use Flutter themes to create coherent branding.
- Extract and refactor Flutter Widgets.
- How to use the GestureDetector Widget to detect a tap.
- Customise Flutter Widgets to achieve a specific design style.
